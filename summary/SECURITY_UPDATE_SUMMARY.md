## 🛡️ Security Improvements

### 1. Create Operations

**Before:**
```bash
POST /api/customers
{
  "tenantId": 999,  # ⚠️ Could send any tenant
  "name": "Customer"
}
```

**After:**
```bash
POST /api/customers
{
  # tenantId removed - auto-set from JWT token ✅
  "name": "Customer"
}
```

### 2. Update Operations

**Before:**
```bash
PUT /api/customers/1
{
  "tenantId": 999,  # ⚠️ Could try to move to another tenant
  "name": "Updated"
}
```

**After:**
```bash
PUT /api/customers/1
{
  # tenantId in request is deleted/ignored ✅
  "name": "Updated"
}
# Original tenantId is preserved
```

## 🔐 Protected Fields

### Immutable After Creation

| Resource | Immutable Fields | Reason |
|----------|------------------|---------|
| **Users** | `tenantId` | Cannot move users between tenants |
| **Customers** | `tenantId` | Cannot move customers between tenants |
| **Loans** | `tenantId`, `customerId` | Cannot change loan ownership |
| **Loan Types** | `tenantId` | Cannot move loan types between tenants |
| **Installments** | `tenantId`, `loanId` | Cannot change installment ownership |

### Auto-Set from Token

| Field | Source | Set On |
|-------|--------|--------|
| `tenantId` | `req.user.tenantId` | All create operations |
| `createdBy` | `req.user.userId` | Customer creation |
| `collectedBy` | `req.user.userId` | Mark installment as paid |

---

## 📊 Impact Summary

### Create Operations (5 endpoints updated)
- ✅ POST `/api/users` - TenantId from token
- ✅ POST `/api/customers` - TenantId from token
- ✅ POST `/api/loans` - TenantId from token
- ✅ POST `/api/loan-types` - TenantId from token
- ✅ POST `/api/installments` - TenantId from token

### Update Operations (5 endpoints updated)
- ✅ PUT `/api/users/:id` - TenantId preserved
- ✅ PUT `/api/customers/:id` - TenantId preserved
- ✅ PUT `/api/loans/:id` - TenantId & CustomerId preserved
- ✅ PUT `/api/loan-types/:id` - TenantId preserved
- ✅ PUT `/api/installments/:id` - TenantId & LoanId preserved

**Total:** 10 endpoints secured

## 💡 Examples

### Example 1: Create Customer

```bash
# Old way (still works but tenantId is ignored)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/customers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "tenantId": 999,
    "name": "Customer"
  }'

# New way (recommended)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/customers \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "Customer",
    "phoneNumber": "+1234567890",
    "email": "customer@example.com"
  }'

# Both create customer for the tenant in JWT token ✅
```

### Example 2: Update Cannot Change Tenant

```bash
# Try to move customer to another tenant
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/customers/1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "tenantId": 999,  // ❌ Ignored
    "name": "Updated Name"
  }'

# Result: Name updated, tenantId unchanged ✅
```

### Example 3: Cannot Access Other Tenant's Data

```bash
# Tenant 1 admin tries to update tenant 2 customer
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/customers/99 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer TENANT1_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"name": "Hacked"}'

# Result: 403 Forbidden ✅
# Message: "Access denied: Customer belongs to different tenant"
```

## 🚀 No Action Required

The changes are **backward compatible**. Existing clients can continue sending `tenantId` in the request body - it will simply be ignored and the value from the JWT token will be used instead.

**Recommended:** Update your client code to stop sending `tenantId` and `userId` in request bodies for cleaner code.
